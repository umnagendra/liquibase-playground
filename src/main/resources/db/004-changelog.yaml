##
# NOTES:
#   - works well for simple "widening" of datatypes (tinyint -> bigint, varchar(64) -> varchar(255) etc.)
#
#   - simple "narrowing" of datatypes (bigint -> smallint, varchar(256) -> varchar(64) etc.) also works,
#     but ONLY as long as the data in all cells of this column can fit into the narrowed datatype
#
#   - automatic casting and conversion of some datatypes is allowed (int -> text, uuid -> varchar(64) etc.),
#     but most of these are one-way only (text -> int does not work)
#
#   - rollback will almost always fail where the conversion is non-trivial with liquibase.exception.RollbackImpossibleException
